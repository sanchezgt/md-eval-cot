## Overview

This repository accompanies the paper:

> **“Multi-Dimensional Evaluation of Auto-Generated Chain-of-Thought Traces in Reasoning Models” (2025)**  

It provides **datasets**, **metrics implementations**, and **reproducible analysis pipelines** used to evaluate the explanatory value of automatically generated reasoning traces (gCoT) beyond fidelity.  

The framework quantifies four complementary axes:

1. **Structural Coherence** – organization and semantic flow.  
2. **Logical–Factual Consistency** – self-consistency and entailment strength.  
3. **Linguistic Clarity** – readability, explicitness, and syntactic simplicity.  
4. **Coverage/Informativeness** – content density and non-redundancy.

## 🧪 Datasets

The datasets contain automatically generated **gCoT traces** (Chain-of-Thought) for the **GSM8K** benchmark, produced by five reasoning-oriented models:

| Model | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B** | 8B dense model distilled from DeepSeek-R1 on Llama-3.1-8B-Base. |
| **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B** | 7B model fine-tuned on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B for reasoning. |
| **GPT-OSS-20B / 120B** | Open-weight Mixture-of-Experts models under Apache 2.0. |
| **Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507** | 4B causal LM with enhanced “thinking” mode. |

Each `.jsonl` record includes:

```json
{
  "id": "gsm8k_001",
  "question": "...",
  "gcot": "...",
  "answer": "...",
  "model": "DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B"
}
```

Metrics Implemented
Coherence

Coherence-Momentum (probabilistic degradation test)

Cross-Encoder coherence (MPNet)

Embedding-based local cohesion

Perplexity (GPT-2 baseline)

Logical–Factual Consistency

NLI-based contradiction detection (DeBERTa-v3-MNLI-FEVER)

AlignScore (support / implication)

FactCC (factual consistency)

Clarity

Flesch Reading Ease (RD)

Step Explicitness (SE)

Definition Coverage (DC)

Syntactic Simplicity (SSₗᵢₜₑ)

Aggregate Clarity Index (CLX)

Logical Verification (Z3)

Implements:

ACS – Aggregate Consistency Score

FAS₀ – Final Answer Soundness

JSS – Justification Set Size

RCR – Redundant Constraint Ratio

Human Evaluation

A complementary human study was conducted using Label Studio, with four expert raters evaluating 400 items (20 problems × 5 models) along four dimensions:
coherence, cohesion, clarity, informativeness.
